# mermaidreporting

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mermaidreporting is to provide utility functions for summarising and visualizing MERMAID data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mermaidreporting with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("data-mermaid/mermaidreporting@development")
```

## Data

Data is available from the [`mermaidr`](https://github.com/data-mermaid/mermaidr/tree/package) package. There are details there on authorization, projects, and endpoints.

Most functions in `mermaidreporting` use aggregated sample events data. For example, to query the aggregated belt fish data for a project:

```{r}
library(mermaidr)

xpdc_sample_events <- mermaid_search_projects(name = "XPDC Kei Kecil 2018") %>%
  mermaid_get_project_endpoint(endpoint = "beltfishes/sampleevents", limit = 25)
```

## Usage

The following demonstrates functions that are available to generate maps, figures, and summary tables. All functions in `mermaidreporting` (and `mermaidr`) are of the form `mermaid_*()`, to take advantage of RStudio auto-completion and make them easier to find when you have other packages loaded.

## Maps

You can generate map of site locations using `mermaid_map_sites_static()` and `mermaid_map_sites_interactive()`, which produce static and interactive maps, respectively:

```{r map-sites-static}
library(mermaidreporting)

mermaid_map_sites_static(xpdc_sample_events)
```

```{r map-sites-interactive, eval = FALSE}
mermaid_map_sites_interactive(xpdc_sample_events)
```

```{r map-sites-interactive-shot, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
m <- mermaid_map_sites_interactive(xpdc_sample_events)
mapview::mapshot(m, file = here::here("man", "figures", "README-mermaid-map-sites-interactive-shot-1.png"))
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-mermaid-map-sites-interactive-shot-1.png")
```

Note that this is just a screenshot of the interacive plot, but you can try it out in an interactive R session by running the above code!

### Mapping by a variable

You can also map sites by the value of a variable. For example, to map sites by mean total biomass:

```{r, map-sites-by-mean-total-biomass}
mermaid_map_sites_static(xpdc_sample_events, biomass_kgha_avg)
```

Or by reef exposure:

```{r, map-sites-by-management_rules}
mermaid_map_sites_static(xpdc_sample_events, reef_exposure)
```

## Figures

### Plot benthic category percent cover

WIP, once new endpoint is available

### Plot fish belt biomass

You can also plot fish belt biomass, split by a grouping variable (such as trophic group) and compared by another variable (such as reef exposure):

```{r plot-fish-family-biomass-management-rules}
xpdc_sample_events %>%
  mermaid_plot_fish_belt_biomass(biomass_kgha_by_trophic_group_avg, reef_exposure)
```

Or by reef zone:

```{r plot-fish-family-biomass-reef-zone}
xpdc_sample_events %>%
  mermaid_plot_fish_belt_biomass(biomass_kgha_by_trophic_group_avg, reef_zone)
```

## Summary Table
